title: All government IT challenges are three things

Looking back on my time in government, and the time after that helping change agents within government modernize their agencies, I realize that the majority of government IT challenges are almost always one of three things: hiring, procurement, and box checking.


### Hiring

Hiring is the threshold issue of most government IT. In the short run, it's "*do the people in charge get it*", whether they're the ones on the front-line implementing the solution or the executives setting the direction and resourcing it. Technology is constantly changing. Ignore that, and you risk falling behind. If the one's tasked with keeping the ship afloat don't realize it's sinking, or worse yet, deny claims from their peers that it is, there's not much hope for meaningful technology or organizational change, at least, not change that'll stick.

In the long run, it's "*can we hire forward-thinking people that push us in the right direction*". The types of technology challenges government are non-trivial, and if you're not able to recruit, hire, and retain the type of talent that stays abreast of day-to-day industry trends, it'll show in your results. Government doesn't need to hire the top 1%, to be sure, but if you look at the technologists in most government IT departments, and the technologists at most moderately successful technology companies, I suspect you'll see very different hiring patterns, in in skill, in expertise, and in commitment to implementing today's industry best practices.

Specifically, it's the reality that government agency's post on USA Jobs as their sole means of recruitment, a site most qualified technologists don't frequent, the false assumptions that the most qualified talent lives in or can move to a specific city, often Washington, D.C., 

IT problems start when those tasked with implementing change don't realize change is necessary, or when you can't

### Procurement

3. 2. Procurement - can we procure modern-thinking developers to implement the project

### Box checking

3. Box checking - security, records, accessibility, etc.
